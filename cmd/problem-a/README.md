This sub directory contains the solution for the leg counter probelm I have faced in a kattis challenge

The input contains four numbers, representing the number of lefs the first, second and third type of animal has and the totalLegs to compare.

The leg-counter.PrintLegCounts takes the input and prints all permunations of 3 animal counts that matches the totalLegs.

If the totalLegs is unatainable for the given input then it prints "impossible"

for example: for the input below
2 4 4 14

the output will be 
1 0 3
1 1 2
1 2 1
1 3 0
3 0 2
3 1 1
3 2 0
5 0 1
5 1 0
7 0 0

and for the following input

100 20 30 10
 the output will be
 impossible
