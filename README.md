This is a simple Go project to solove the challenges I have faced in a test.

The cmd/ sub-directory contains the solutions and each solution is placed in it dedicated sub-directory

The instructions to provide the input and the output format are described in README file under each sub-directory.

To run the solution, run the corresponding main.go file in those sub-directories using the following command.

go run main.go
